            I'm getting rid of my clothes I don't wear
            I think I'm gonna cut my hair
            'Cause these days I don't feel like me, mm
            I think I'm gonna take a break from alcohol
            Probably won't last that long
            But Lord knows I could use some sleep, mm
            Changes, they might drive you half-insane
            But it's killing you to stay the same
            But it's all gonna work out, it's all gonna work out someday
            Moments, livin' with your eyes half-open
            You've been thinking 'bout these changes
            It's all gonna work out, it's all gonna work out someday
            I think I'm gonna take some pills to fix my brain
            'Cause I tried every other way
            But some things you can't fix yourself
            But he said that he's doing the same thing over and over
            And life ain't easy these days, no, life ain't easy these days
            Changes, they might drive you half-insane (Changes)
            But it's killing you to stay the same (Changes)
            But it's all gonna work out, it's all gonna work out someday (Work out someday)
            Moments, livin' with your eyes half-open (Eyes half-open)
            You've been thinking 'bout these changes (Changes)
            It's all gonna work out, it's all gonna work out someday
            Na-na-na-na-na-na-na
            Na-na-na-na-na-na
            Na-na-na-na-na-na-na
            Na-na-na-na-na-na
            Na-na-na-na-na-na-na
            Na-na-na-na-na-na
            Na-na-na-na-na-na-na
            Na-na-na-na-na-na
            Changes, they might drive you half-insane
            But it's killing you to stay the same
            But it's all gonna work out, it's all gonna work out someday (Someday)
            Moments, living with your eyes half-open (Half-open)
            You've been thinking 'bout these changes (Changes)
            It's all gonna work out, it's all gonna work out someday
